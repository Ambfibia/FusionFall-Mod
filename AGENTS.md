# AGENTS

## Development
- Use four spaces for indentation and keep code comments in Russian.
- Run `dotnet build` from the repository root after modifying files. If the build fails due to missing dependencies, record the failure in the PR.

## Commit messages
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
