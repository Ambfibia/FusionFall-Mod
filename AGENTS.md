# AGENTS

## Development
- Use four spaces for indentation and keep code comments in Russian.
- Run `dotnet build` from the repository root after modifying files. If the build fails due to missing dependencies, record the failure in the PR.
- Search the project for existing functions before implementing new ones, and reuse them when possible.
- Put each class, enum, record, and struct in its own file.
- Use full, non-abbreviated names for variables and classes.
- Do not use `var`; specify explicit data types.

## Commit messages
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
